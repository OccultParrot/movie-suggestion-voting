## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Have you ever been at a movie night with friends where you ended up leaving and not watching a movie because your friends couldnt agree on a movie?
- Our movie voting app is a fun tool to use with friends and family. Our app takes everyones choice into consideration while also using metrics to decide between for example: Barbie the movie or Captain America.
- Our interactive allows the user to suggest a movie, vote on a movie and tally up the votes.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
First the user invites other users to suggest a movie.
then the users vote on the suggested movies this could be any number suggestion.
the user is then able to see the results of the voting poll.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

`assets/images/Movievoting1.jpg`
`assets/images/Movievoting2.jpg`
`assets/images/Movievoting3.jpg`
`assets/images/Movievoting4.jpg`
