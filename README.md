# Movie Voting Website/Movte

## Description 
Have you ever been at a movie night with friends where you ended up leaving and not watching a movie because your friends couldnt agree on a movie?

Our movie voting app is a fun tool to use with friends and family. Our app takes everyones choice into consideration while also using metrics to decide between for example: Barbie the movie or Captain America.

Our interactive website allows the user to suggest a movie, vote on a movie and tally up the votes.
